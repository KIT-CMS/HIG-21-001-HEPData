comment: "Three searches are presented for signatures of physics beyond the standard model (SM)
          in $\\tau\\tau$ final states in proton-proton collisions at the CERN LHC,
          using a data sample collected with the CMS detector at $\\sqrt{s} = 13\\text{ TeV}$,
          corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $138\\text{ fb}^{-1}$.
          Upper limits at $95\\%$ confidence level ($\\text{CL}$) are set on the products of
          the branching fraction for the decay into $\\tau$ leptons and the cross sections
          for the production of a new boson $\\phi$, accompanying the $\\text{H}(125)$ boson,
          via gluon fusion ($gg\\phi$) or in association with b quarks, ranging from
          $\\mathcal{O}(10\\text{ pb})$ (at $60\\text{ GeV}$) to $0.3\\text{ fb}$
          (at $3.5\\text{ TeV}$) each. The data reveal two excesses for $gg\\phi$ production
          with local $p$-values equivalent to about three standard deviations at $0.1$ and
          $1.2\\text{ TeV}$. In a search for $t$-channel exchange of a vector leptoquark $\\text{U}_{1}$,
          $95\\%\\text{ CL}$ upper limits are set on the $\\text{U}_{1}$ coupling to quarks and
          $\\tau$ leptons ranging from $1$ (at $1\\text{ TeV}$) to $6$ (at $5\\text{ TeV}$), depending on the scenario.
          In the interpretation of minimal supersymmetric SM benchmark scenarios, additional Higgs bosons
          with masses below $350\\text{ GeV}$ are excluded at $95\\%\\text{ CL}$."

description: "Observed and expected distributions of the variable chosen for statistical inference in the high-mass analysis $m_{T}^{tot}$.
              Numerical values provided in this table correspond to Figure 7f of the publication, but restricted to 2018 data-taking year.
              All distributions are considered after a fit to data is performed using a background-only model, which includes the $\\text{H}(125)$ boson.
              Some details on how the distributions should be used:\n\n

              1) All given uncertainties correspond to systematic uncertainties.\n
              2) Upper values ('plus' in the yaml file) correspond to an upward systematic variation of the parameter.\n
              3) Lower values ('minus' in the yaml file) correspond to a downward systematic variation of the parameter.\n
              4) These variations can have both positive and negative values, depending on the modelled effect.\n
              5) Uncertainties with the same name should be treated as correlated, consistently across the upper and lower variations.\n
              6) Systematic uncertainties with $\\texttt{prop_}$ in the name treat limited statistics per histogram bin, and are deployed with 'Barlow-Beeston lite' approach.\n
              7) Remaining systematic uncertainties alter the normalization, the shape, or both for a distribution. These parameters can be modelled with a Gaussian kernel.\n"
