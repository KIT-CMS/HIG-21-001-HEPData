comment: "Three searches are presented for signatures of physics beyond the standard model (SM)
          in $\\tau\\tau$ final states in proton-proton collisions at the CERN LHC,
          using a data sample collected with the CMS detector at $\\sqrt{s} = 13\\text{ TeV}$,
          corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $138\\text{ fb}^{-1}$.
          Upper limits at $95\\%$ confidence level ($\\text{CL}$) are set on the products of
          the branching fraction for the decay into $\\tau$ leptons and the cross sections
          for the production of a new boson $\\phi$, accompanying the $\\text{H}(125)$ boson,
          via gluon fusion ($gg\\phi$) or in association with b quarks, ranging from
          $\\mathcal{O}(10\\text{ pb})$ (at $60\\text{ GeV}$) to $0.3\\text{ fb}$
          (at $3.5\\text{ TeV}$) each. The data reveal two excesses for $gg\\phi$ production
          with local $p$-values equivalent to about three standard deviations at $0.1$ and
          $1.2\\text{ TeV}$. In a search for $t$-channel exchange of a vector leptoquark $\\text{U}_{1}$,
          $95\\%\\text{ CL}$ upper limits are set on the $\\text{U}_{1}$ coupling to quarks and
          $\\tau$ leptons ranging from $1$ (at $1\\text{ TeV}$) to $6$ (at $5\\text{ TeV}$), depending on the scenario.
          In the interpretation of minimal supersymmetric SM benchmark scenarios, additional Higgs bosons
          with masses below $350\\text{ GeV}$ are excluded at $95\\%\\text{ CL}$."

description: "Scan of the likelihood function for the search for a pseudoscalar resonance ($A$) with a mass of $180\\text{ GeV}$,
              produced via gluon-fusion or in association with b quarks. For this scan, we assume the $ggA$ and $bbA$
              processes are only influenced by the Yukawa couplings to the top and bottom quarks and we scale the cross sections predicted
              for a SM-like Higgs boson of the same mass depending on these couplings. For the $ggA$ process, there is also an enhancement
              to the cross section for a pseudoscalar resonance compared to the equivalent process for the production of a scalar.
              This enhancement is taken into account when scaling the cross sections for the SM-like Higgs boson. The scans are displayed
              for the product of the reduced Yukawa couplings $g_{b,\\,t}^{A}$ and the square root of the branching fraction for the $A\\rightarrow\\tau\\tau$

description: "Expected $95\\%\\text{ CL}$ exclusion contour in the MSSM $M_{h\\,\\text{EFT}}^{125}$ scenario,
              evaluated at the $97.5\\%$ quantile of the test-statistic distribution $f(\\tilde{q}_\\mu|\\text{SM})$ under SM hypothesis.
              This contour is part of the $95\\%$ confidence interval band.
              Numerical values provided in this table correspond to the expected $97.5\\%$ quantile contour of Figure 12a of the publication."
